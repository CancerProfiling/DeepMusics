The pipeline for the preparation of the datasets
1. You can choose the omic types according to your own projects. It does not have to be the four omics type at the same time.
Some other clinical information including age,sex,weight or subtype,stage etc can also be the predicted labels.
2. The different types of omics data in one expriment have to be from the same cohorts of patients.
3. The default set of omics data is snapped the gene level. 
If your data are not in the gene level, the pathway layer have to be redefined accordingly.

The example datasets for running DeepMusics are given in the DeepMusics/experiments/data/single-omics and DeepMusics/experiments/data/multi-omics.
