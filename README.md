# DeepMultiOmics
For any cancer type or subtype, it is difficult to see the whole landscape of molecular features with high dimensions and multiple sequencing data sources. 
The Multi-Omics including mutations,expressions,methlations,clinical information and cancer pathway prior knowledge information.
Our goal is to use deep learning method to fit embedding from all kinds of omics to analysis pan cancers in a general way.
Here we use several common cancer types to show how the framework was built and tested.
